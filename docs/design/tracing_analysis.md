# Transform Algorithm Tracing Analysis

## Input
- doc: "abcde"
- op1: [retain(2), insert("xyz"), retain(3)] → "abxyzcde"
- op2: [retain(1), delete(3), retain(1)] → "ae"

## What Actually Needs to Happen

### For op1' (transforms from "ae" to final result)
1. We start with "ae" 
2. op1 wants to:
   - retain(2) - but in "ae" context, position 1 is "e" (was position 4 in original)
   - insert("xyz") after position 1 - this happens between "a" and "e"
   - retain(3) - but there's only 1 character left ("e")

So op1' should be:
- retain(1) - keep "a"
- insert("xyz") - insert at correct position
- retain(1) - keep "e"
Result: "axyze"

### For op2' (transforms from "abxyzcde" to final result)  
1. We start with "abxyzcde"
2. op2 wants to:
   - retain(1) - keep "a"
   - delete(3) - delete "bcd" but now there's "bxyz" followed by "cde"
   - retain(1) - keep "e"

So op2' should be:
- retain(1) - keep "a"
- delete(1) - delete "b"
- retain(3) - keep "xyz" (inserted by op1)
- delete(2) - delete "cd"
- retain(1) - keep "e"
Result: "axyze"

## Current Algorithm Issue

The algorithm is building operations as if they will be applied in their original context, not their transformed context. It's not properly accounting for how one operation changes the document that the other will see.

## The Key Insight

The algorithm must build:
- aResult: operations that transform from b's OUTPUT to the final state
- bResult: operations that transform from a's OUTPUT to the final state

Not operations that transform from the original document!
