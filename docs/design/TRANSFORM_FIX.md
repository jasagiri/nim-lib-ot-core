# Transform Algorithm Fix

## Summary

Fixed the transform algorithm to correctly handle all operation combinations, particularly the insert-insert case which was failing.

## The Bug

The original implementation was incorrectly handling the iteration through operations after processing inserts. When op1 was an insert, after processing it and calling `continue`, the algorithm would reload both operations instead of just op1. This caused op2's insert to be skipped.

## The Fix

The fix involved pre-loading operations before the main loop (similar to ot.js reference implementation) and only advancing the operation that was just processed, not both operations.

Key changes:
1. Pre-load op1 and op2 before the main loop
2. After processing an insert, only advance that specific operation
3. Maintain proper operation validity tracking

## Test Results

All tests now pass:
- Insert-Insert: ✅
- Insert-Delete: ✅ 
- Retain-Delete: ✅

The transform function now correctly implements the Operational Transformation algorithm as specified in the ot.js reference implementation.
