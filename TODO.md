# nim-lib-ot - Operational Transformation Library for Nim

## Project Overview
Operational Transformation library implemented in Nim for real-time collaborative editing.

## Project Status: COMPLETED ✓

All phases have been successfully completed, with a fully functional OT library that includes:

- Core operations (insert, delete, retain)
- Transformation functions for concurrent edits
- Client-side implementation with state management
- Server-side implementation with operation handling
- Protocol and serialization for network communication
- Undo/redo and history management
- Complete documentation and examples

## Performance Benchmarks

On a 10,000 character document (release build):
- Apply operations: 0.072ms per operation
- Transform operations: 0.0014ms per transform
- Client-server operations: 0.109ms per operation
- History operations: 0.0057ms per operation

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Property-based tests for random operations
- Integration tests for client-server interaction
- Performance testing

## Development Principles
1. Strong type safety
2. Clear error handling (using Result type)
3. Utilization of pure functions
4. Compatibility with existing implementations
5. High test coverage

## Library Components

1. **Types Module** - Core data structures
2. **Operations Module** - Basic operations management
3. **Transform Module** - Operational transformation algorithm
4. **Client Module** - Client-side implementation
5. **Server Module** - Server-side implementation
6. **Protocol Module** - Network communication
7. **Cursor Module** - Cursor transformation
8. **History Module** - Undo/redo functionality

All components are now fully implemented and tested.
